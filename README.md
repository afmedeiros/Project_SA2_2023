This is a mobile app project that we developed during the second semester at Senai. It was built in approximately one month using React with the purpose of recording measurements in sectors previously created by the user. We worked on this project using React, CSS, and mySQL.

--01/07/2023 v1.0 working project but need some fixes 

--01/07/2023 v1.1 check readme
1) During the test, I noticed that when registering a new measurement, the screen didn't return to the main Medição screen. I fixed this issue by making it navigate to the Medição screen after the measurement is registered in db. Same ocurred in Relatorios screen. 
2) Change some texts in buttons
